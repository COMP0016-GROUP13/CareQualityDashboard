# LikertScaleQuestion

The `LikertScaleQuestion` component is used on the Self-reporting page to allow clinicians to record the extent they agree with a certain
question, also giving them a training URL linked to that question.

<Props of={LikertScaleQuestion} />

## Basic usage

<Playground>
  <LikertScaleQuestion
    onChange={value => {
      null;
    }}
    questionNumber={1}
    questionUrl="http://www.wales.nhs.uk/governance-emanual/theme-5-timely-care"
    question="This is a good test question?"
    showError={false}
  />
</Playground>
