# NewUserForm

The `NewUserForm` component is used on the platform administrator manage page to allow them to add new users with the `hospital` or `health_board` user type.

It consists of a form that asks for the relevant details depending on the user type being added, and handles the form submission itself.

The form allows the user to automatically generate a random (plaintext) password; the intention is that this should be shared to new users so they can update their password.

<Props of={NewUserForm} />

It is normally used in the Admin Manage Page.

## Basic usage

<Playground>
  <NewUserForm
    userType="health_board"
    onError={console.error}
    onSuccess={() => console.log('Success!')}
  />
</Playground>
