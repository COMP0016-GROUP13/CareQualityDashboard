# DepartmentsTable

The `DepartmentsTable` component displays a table with all the departments in the logged in users hospital. It allows the Hospital user
type to add and delete departments and also copy/regenerate each join URL. (if it can't fetch data from the backend, the table only shows
the column names)

<Props of={DepartmentsTable} />

It is normally used in the manage page for the Hospital user type.

## Basic usage

<Playground>
  <DepartmentsTable host="example.com" />
</Playground>
