# WordsQuestion

The `WordsQuestion` component is used in the self-reporting page to give clinicians an oppurtunity to submit up to 3 words related to their
reports experience. It also has an auto suggest to suggest previously used words on the platform.

<Props of={WordsQuestion} />

<Playground>
  <WordsQuestion
    onChange={value => {
      null;
    }}
    questionNumber={1}
    question="Type 't' to test it out"
    suggestedWords={['test', 'test1', 'test2', 'thisTest']}
  />
</Playground>
