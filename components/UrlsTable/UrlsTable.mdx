# UrlsTable

The `UrlsTable` component displays a table with all the questions and the urls specific to that department. It allows only the urls of
the questions to be edited or set to the default global URL. It also uses the [`ClinicianJoinCode`](/ClinicianJoinCode) component to allow
the user to manage their join URL for their department. (if it can't fetch data from the backend, the table only shows the column names)

<Props of={UrlsTable} />

It is normally used in the manage page for the Department user type.

## Basic usage

<Playground>
  <UrlsTable host="example.com" />
</Playground>
