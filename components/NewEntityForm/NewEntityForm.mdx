# NewEntityForm

The `NewEntityForm` component is used on the platform administrator manage page to allow them to add new hospitals or health boards to the system.

It consists of a form that asks for the relevant details depending on the user type being added, and handles the form submission itself.

<Props of={NewEntityForm} />

It is normally used in the Admin Manage Page.

## Basic usage

<Playground>
  <NewEntityForm
    healthBoard
    onError={console.error}
    onSuccess={() => console.log('Success!')}
  />
</Playground>
